# WeatherPy-with-Python-APIs
Week 6 Challenge

## Purpose: 
This analysis consists of a python script to visualize data points of the weather of cities worldwide, varying in temperature and humidity. In this project, we use APIs to request an Open Weather Map to create a series of tools for travelers in order to plan a trip based on the location, weather conditions, and the traveling routes/ itinerary.

## Conclusion: 
Using the latitudes and longitudes, along with the Open Weather Map, we were able to provide tools to plan a trip using google maps with the weather conditions for the selected regions. 
This was a challenging assignment since it was my first time working with APIs, which resulted in a number of research regarding how they operate and how they can be implemented in our analysis.
